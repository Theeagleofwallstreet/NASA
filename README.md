# NASA Dataset

This repository contains the NASA dataset, which provides information on various astronomical objects. The dataset includes the following features:

- Temperature: The temperature of the astronomical object.
- L: The luminosity of the astronomical object.
- R: The radius of the astronomical object.
- A_M: The absolute magnitude of the astronomical object.
- Color: The color of the astronomical object.
- Spectral_Class: The spectral class of the astronomical object.
- Type: The type of the astronomical object.

## Dataset Information

The dataset provides valuable information for astronomical research and analysis. It can be used to study the characteristics of different astronomical objects and explore relationships between their features.

## Repository Contents

- `nasa_dataset.csv`: The CSV file containing the NASA dataset.
- `data_exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data exploration examples on the NASA dataset.
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing examples on the NASA dataset.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with machine learning model training examples on the NASA dataset.

## Getting Started

To use the NASA dataset, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/theeagleofwallstreet/nasa-dataset.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Explore the dataset by running the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook, which provides examples of data visualization and analysis.

4. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and prepare it for machine learning tasks using the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

5. Train machine learning models on the dataset using the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

Feel free to customize and modify the code according to your specific requirements and research goals.
